# Work Sample

### Instructions

* Fork this repository and create a new feature branch. 
* Implement a search application consisting of a search field and a list with the search results. See the attached graphics in the folder 'UX'.
* The search app should use a public REST API of your choice. For example [restful-webservices-to-get-and-search-countries](http://www.groupkt.com/post/c9b0ccb9/restful-webservices-to-get-and-search-countries.htm).
* When searching for a name, display suggestions in a list beneath the search field.
* When clicking enter add a list item that displays name and country code or similar with a date added in a list beneath the search field. Similar to a search history.
* Nothing needs to be saved if the page is reloaded.
* Logo and search icon can be found in the folder icons.
* Please use React and feel free to use other frameworks :-)

### What will we look at:
* Check that the solution and structure is properly created.
* HTML, CSS and JS code is well written.

Solve the task as far as you think is necessary.

When you are done push your branch, create a pull request and let us know you are done.

Thank you.
